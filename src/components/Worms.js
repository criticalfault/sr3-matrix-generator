const Worms = {
    "Crashworm":"Crashworms seek to undermine the integrity of utilities, causing them to crash or suffer from induced errors. Whenever a utility is activated on a cyberterminal infected with crashworms, make a Worm Rating Test against the rating of the utility. If the utility has the crashguard option (see p. 83), add the crashguard rating as a target number modifier. If successful, the utility suffers errors and must roll on the Glitch Table (see p. 82).",
    "Deathworm":"A deathworm infection impedes the cyberterminal's functioning from within. All tests made by the persona, including Attack and Resistance Tests made during cybercombat, suffer a target number modifier equal to the deathworm rating รท 2 (round down).",
    "Dataworm":"Dataworms reside on a cyberterminal and carefully log everything the persona does: the jackpoints it uses, the systems it logs onto, the accounts and passcodes it uses, the files it accesses the utilities it uses (including ratings and options) and so on. The dataworm secretly accumulates all of this data in a hidden file on the cyberterminal and seeks to transmit it to a predetermined destination on a periodic basis. Each time a dataworm-infected cyberterminal logs on to a grid, roll 1D6. On a result of 1, the dataworm tries to send a report chock-full of incriminating evidence back to its owner.\n\n At the same time, make a Sensor (4 + Worm Rating) Test for the cyberterminal's user. If the test fails, the data payload is sent away without being discovered. If the test succeeds, the user notices the dataworm report and may engage it in cybercombat to destroy it before it gets away.\n\n In cybercombat, dataworm reports act as standard icons with rating +3D6 Initiative and an effective Evasion rating equal to the worm rating. They possess no offensive capabilities, but will maneuver to evade detection (see Cybercombat, p. 224, SR3). If the dataworm report has evaded the user at the end of any Combat Turn, it escapes. Dataworm reports are always considered to be illegitimate icons for purposes of cybercombat. The effects of dataworm reports depend on the events in the adventure. Depending on the information logged and who receives it, the user may find himself targeted for arrest or assassination, his Matrix haunts under surveillance or raided, and/or his associates killed or chased underground.",
    "Tapeworm":"Tapeworms erase files downloaded onto the cyberterminal. Whenever the user downloads a file, make a Worm Rating (MPCP) Test as soon as the download is complete. If successful, the tapeworm corrupts the information and renders it irretrievable.",
    "Ringworm":"Unlike their counterparts, ringworms are relatively benign; they are primarily used as a prankster tool. Ringworms are programmed to alter the coding of a persona's icon to change its appearance. These changes can be minor (perhaps causing the icon to flicker or buzz with static) or drastic (changing an imposing samurai warrior icon to a fluffy pink kitty). When a ringworm invades a cyberterminal, make a Worm Rating (Icon Rating) Test. If successful, the ringworm alters the icon as it has been programmed; use successes to determine the extent of these changes."
